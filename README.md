# HITCalculator

This repository contains the code for creating a shinyapp using R and the code for creating a slidify slide presentation, which explains what the shinyapp does.

## Purpose of the shiny app

With a resurgence of measles cases in the United States in the 21st century, 
after near erradication in the last one, vaccination rates and public health policy
for mandatory vs optional childhood vaccination programs has become an important debate.
This app calculates a vaccination threshold, also known as the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT)
for measles and compares US state-wide MMR vaccination rates for children (19-35 months old)
to the threshold based on the National Immunization Survey ( at least 1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine).
An important aim of the app is to account for the variation in both the HIT 
calculation and the vaccination rates, and visually display the results in a way that makes
the uncertainty and wide range of outcomes, apparent visually.
